#**Introduction**
```
My name is Frederikke and i a Danish Medical student, who is in SF until May, 
doing research within Psychiatry as a part of my Master thesis.

I have no experince in coding and programning before, but have had a software inginer friend, who made a lot
of my work easier by writing a code that could sort my data, which saved med hours of work. Thus i would
like to learn some coding to make it easier to do my research.
